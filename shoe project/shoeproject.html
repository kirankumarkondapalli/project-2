				<h2>crush your Comfort zone-adidas</h2>
				<p class="posted">Posted October 15, 2018</p>
				<p> These adidas shoes are certainly a classic, and most people will 
own a pair of these. They are available in a whole variety of colors and women can 
even wear them too, as they are also called as unisex. They are
made from synthetic water-resistant materials on the outside, 
making them very suitable for all types of weather conditions. They 
are also a lace-up type of shoes, which makes them very easy to 
wear, plus, if they do become a little loose, you can easily tighten 
them up. They have textile lining inside the shoe, making them 
comfortable.</p>
